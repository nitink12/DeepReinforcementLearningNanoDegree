# Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree
## Project 1: Navigation - report

### Solution
To execute this project a DQN algorithm was implemented.

### Performance
The agent achieved average score of more than 15 over 100 (as described below) consecutive episodes after 772 episodes of training.

Episode 100	Average Score: 1.04

Episode 200	Average Score: 4.80

Episode 300	Average Score: 7.82

Episode 400	Average Score: 11.16

Episode 500	Average Score: 12.11

Episode 600	Average Score: 13.17

Episode 700	Average Score: 14.02

Episode 800	Average Score: 14.57

Episode 872	Average Score: 15.03

Environment solved in 772 episodes!	Average Score: 15.03

### Ideas for Future Work
* Implement Prioritize Experience Replay
* Implement Dueling Architecture
* Implement n-step bootstrapping and/or other techniques described in Rainbow
