# Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree
## Project 1: Navigation - report

### Solution
To execute this project a DQN algorithm was implemented.

### Performance
The agent achieved average score of more than 15 over 100 consecutive episodes after 772 episodes of training.

### Ideas for Future Work
* Implement Prioritize Experience Replay
* Implement Dueling Architecture
* Implement n-step bootstrapping and/or other techniques described in Rainbow
